  abstract = {It is vital to select microarchitectures to achieve good trade-offs between performance, power, and area in the chip development cycle. Combining high-level hardware description languages and optimization of electronic design automation tools empowers microarchitecture exploration at the circuit level. Due to the extremely large design space and high runtime cost to evaluate a microarchitecture, ICCAD 2022 CAD Contest Problem C calls for an effective design space exploration algorithm to solve the problem. We formulate the research topic as a contest problem and provide benchmark suites, contest benchmark platforms, etc., for all contestants to innovate and estimate their algorithms.},
